## 🔍 How It Works

UniFAS uses state-of-the-art facial recognition technology to identify individuals and track their attendance. The system works in three main steps:

1. **Registration**: Users register by providing their information and capturing their face  
2. **Recognition**: The system identifies registered users through the webcam  
3. **Recording**: Attendance is automatically recorded when a registered face is recognized

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 (recommended)  
- pip (Python package manager)  
- Git  

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hossmekkawy/UniFAS.git
cd UniFAS
```

### Step 2: Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install dependencies

```bash
# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install NumPy first (important for compatibility)
pip install numpy==1.22.3

# Install other dependencies
pip install Flask==2.0.1 Werkzeug==2.0.1 Jinja2==3.0.1 itsdangerous==2.0.1 MarkupSafe==2.0.1
pip install opencv-python-headless==4.5.5.64
pip install dlib
pip install face_recognition==1.3.0
pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy==2.5.1
```

> 💡 **Note:** If you encounter issues installing dlib, try using a pre-built wheel:

```bash
# For Python 3.10 on Windows 64-bit
pip install https://github.com/jloh02/dlib/releases/download/v19.22/dlib-19.22.99-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl
```

### Step 4: Generate SSL certificates for HTTPS

```bash
# Windows (using OpenSSL)
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout key.pem -days 365
```

Follow the prompts to complete the certificate.

### Step 5: Run the application

```bash
python app.py
```

Access it at: https://localhost:5000  
You may need to accept a security warning (self-signed certificate).

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Face Recognition Pipeline (using `face_recognition`)

```python
# Face Detection
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)

# Face Encoding
face_encodings = face_recognition.face_encodings(image, face_locations)

# Face Comparison
matches = face_recognition.compare_faces(known_encodings, face_encoding)

# Best Match
face_distances = face_recognition.face_distance(known_encodings, face_encoding)
best_match_index = np.argmin(face_distances)
```

### Database Structure (SQLAlchemy with SQLite)

- **User Model**: Stores user info and face encoding  
- **Attendance Model**: Records timestamp and user ID  

### Frontend Tech

- TailwindCSS  
- AlpineJS  
- Jinja2 templates
